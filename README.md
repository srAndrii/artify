# Artify Project Overview

Artify is a digital platform developed using the Next.js framework, providing artists and art enthusiasts a space to discover, share, and purchase art. The project is bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, offering a comprehensive solution for managing artworks online.

- **Stripe**: Integrated for handling payment processes, allowing users to purchase artworks securely.
- **React.js**: Used alongside Next.js for building the user interface with reusable components.
- **Material-UI**: A React UI framework providing pre-built material components for faster and easier web development.
- **SASS**: For styling, enhancing CSS with more powerful features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.

This project harnesses the power of modern web technologies to create a seamless and interactive experience for art lovers and creators alike.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
